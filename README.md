Minecraft Maze Builder

### Concept
This code is created to support CoderDojo sessions and help bringing children into programming. It gives an example for something that can be achieved with moderate effort, for children to fork the project and expand it. Initially I wanted to create an easy way of building a maze into Minecraft.

### User interface
Built with Tkinter following (partially) this tutorial http://thinkingtkinter.sourceforge.net/#contents_item_4

### Further ideas
1. Build maze based on photo taken
2. Load photo and recreate photo on Minecraft with blocks
